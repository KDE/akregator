A KDE Feed Reader.

Join developer mailing list: <kde-pim@kde.org>

If you wish to discuss any problems or features before posting them on bugs.kde.org
you can subscribe to that mailing list as well.

Please notice that we ask you to post your bugs and wishes to bugs.kde.org not only
because this is official KDE bug tracker, but because this helps us keep an eye on
demand of the community and not forget to implement needed things ;)

Also please do not abuse bug tracker functionality by submitting duplicate items.
Check the existing bugs first (for example using power user tool available at
<https://bugs.kde.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=1681242&product=akregator>). If you find something very close
to your request, just add a comment and vote for the bug (there's a little vote link on the
bug summary pane).

And enjoy your Akregator!
