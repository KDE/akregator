The Metakit Library 2.4.9.5                                           Nov 2005
==============================================================================


WHAT IT IS - Metakit is an embeddable database which runs on Unix, Windows,
    Macintosh, and other platforms.  It lets you build applications which
    store their data efficiently, in a portable way, and which will not need a
    complex runtime installation.  In terms of the data model, Metakit takes
    the middle ground between RDBMS, OODBMS, and flat-file databases - yet it
    is quite different from each of them.

TECHNOLOGY - Everything is stored variable-sized yet with efficient positional
    row access.  Changing an existing datafile structure is as simple as re-
    opening it with that new structure.  All changes are transacted, including
    restructuring.  You can mix and match software written in C++, Python,
    and Tcl.  Things can't get much more flexible...

CORE - The Metakit core library is written in C++.  It has a code footprint of
    just over 100 Kb on Windows.  It can be used as DLL, or linked statically.
    Debug builds include extensive assertion checks to catch problems early.

PYTHON - The binding for Python is called "Mk4py".  It uses SCXX by Gordon
    McMillan as C++ glue interface.  The source is in directory "python/".

TCL/TK - The MK extension for Tcl is called "Mk4tcl".  It is being used in a
    number of commercial projects.  The source is in directory "tcl/".

LICENSE AND SUPPORT - Metakit is now distributed as open source software (the
    X/MIT-style license is at the end of this document).  Commercial support
    is available through an Enterprise License, see the URL mentioned below.

DOCUMENTATION - All documentation uses HTML.  The main page is "Metakit.html",
    which leads to the rest of the documentation in the "doc/" directory.
    The C++ API Reference is extracted from the source code using Doxygen.

    including Kyrill Denisenko, Mark Roseman, Gordon McMillan, Matt Newman,
    Christian Tismer, John Bushakra, Steve Landers, Jacob Levy, John Barnard,
    Nicholas Riley, Brian Kelley, and many more people who have reported bugs
    and helped fix them.  Last but not least, many thanks to all enterprise
    license customers and all my clients for funding Metakit work.


INSTALLATION
============

(NOTE to Python users: you could also do "cd python; python setup.py ...")

All platform builds and language bindings are designed to work from a single
common "builds/" directory.  Where possible, that is - it turns out to be
impossible to keep build side-effects limited to *just* this directory
(CodeWarrior can't be told where to place its temp data, and Visual C++ still
alters a few files next to the project ".dsw" file, to name two offenders).

UNIX (ALSO MAC OS X)

    It is no longer advised to build the Unix code in the "unix/" directory.
    Instead, you should perform the following steps:
        % cd builds
        % ../unix/configure
        % make
        % make test
    And optionally (this only installs the core lib, not script extensions):
        % make install

    By switching to the "builds/" directory, you will keep the distribution
    directory tree 100% unaltered.  All changes are made in this subdir, and
    all final build results are left behind in this same subdir.

    To build with STL containers and strings, you can do the following:
        make CXXFLAGS='-Dq4_STD' test   # add -O3 etc, as needed

    To build the Mk4tcl extension on Unix, change the configure to:
        % ../unix/configure --with-tcl=<dir-where-tcl.h-is>
    To build the Mk4py extension on Unix, change the configure to:
        % ../unix/configure --with-python=<dir-where-include/-is>
    E.g.
        % ../unix/configure --with-tcl=/usr/include --with-python=/usr

    Use "../unix/configure --help" to find out about other variants, when the
    include & lib dirs are completely different, and for other build options.

WINDOWS

    There is a "win/" directory which contains subdirectories for a number of
    compiler systems.  Metakit has been built with many different compilers
    in the past (Microsoft, Borland, Watcom, Symantec, Metrowerks, Optima),
    only a few are maintained (there are 12 configurations for MSVC6 alone!).

    The MS Visual C++ 6.0 project is "win/msvc60/mksrc.dsw", with subprojects
    for the C++ demo (mkdemo), building dll's (mkdll), static libs (mklib),
    regression tests (mktest), as well as Tcl (mktcl) and Python (mkpython).
    It has been set up to place all intermediate files and final results in
    the "builds/" subdirectory, even though you'll launch it from "win/".

    An MSVC 7.0 project by David Van Maren is in win/msvc70/mksrc.sln.

    To build with STL containers and strings under MSVC, define "q4_STD".
    To build with MFC containers and strings under MSVC, define "q4_MFC".

    The Metrowerks Codewarrior project is in the "mac/" directory, and can be
    used to build both Mac and Windows versions (on either Mac *or* Windows).
    The core libraries are built with "mac/cw5.mcp", demos / tests are built
    with "cw5apps.mcp", Tcl is "cw5tcl.mcp", and Python is "cw5python.mcp".

    The Borland C++ Builder projects have not yet been incorporated in this
    release, but the "KitViewer" application is an example of how to use BCB.

    The Cygwin build (B20.1 / gcc 2.95.2) is different, because it uses the
    unix autoconf system, and must be launched as described above for UNIX.
    I have upgraded to the latest development of libtool to be able to build
    DLL's with Cygwin.  You can build the "-mno-cygwin" version by editing
    the Makefile by hand and adding that option to CXXFLAGS.

    Rob Bloodgood adds that the following GCC options are for maximum code
    efficiency on x86 hardware: "-O2 -m486 -malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2".
    I have not yet tried this myself, but am passing on the tip.

MACINTOSH CLASSIC

    The Mac version requires Metrowerks CodeWarrior 6.  See the info above
    in the Windows section (MWCW is multi-platform).  The projects are all
    located in the "mac/" folder, which is also where MWCW will place its own
    "... Data" folders with intermediate results.  As with all other setups,
    final results are made to end up in the "builds/" directory.
